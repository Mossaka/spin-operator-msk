# Apps

This directory contains source code for Spin apps that are used by the `spin-operator` samples found in `config/samples/` directory. When you add a new app you need to add it to the `publish-image` matrix in [`.github/workflows/sample-apps.yaml`](../.github/workflows/sample-apps.yaml) file.
