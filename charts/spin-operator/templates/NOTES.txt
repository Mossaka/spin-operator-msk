spin-operator {{ .Chart.Version }} is now deployed!

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} get all {{ .Release.Name }}

Note: spin-operator requires a few additional resources to be present on the
Kubernetes cluster before it can run the first Spin application.

1. Install the spin-operator CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) resources:

  $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}/spin-operator.crds.yaml

2. Install the wasmtime-spin-v2 RuntimeClass:

  $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}/spin-operator.runtime-class.yaml

3. Finally, install the containerd wasm shim on at least one node. This shim is
necessary for running Spin application workloads. We use the Kwasm Operator
to handle this installation, via node annotations.

  $ kubectl annotate node <node> kwasm.sh/kwasm-node=true

You are now ready to deploy your first Spin app!
